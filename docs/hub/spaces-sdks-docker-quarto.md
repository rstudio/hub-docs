2. **Install Quarto**: In order to render your Quarto site without Docker, we recommend installing Quarto by following the instructions on the [official Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

3. **Install Quarto VS Code extension** the [Quarto VS Code Extention](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/vscode.html) includes a number of productivity tools including YAML Autocomplete, a preview button, and a visual editor. Quarto works great with VS Code, but the extension does make it easier to get the most out of Quarto.

4. **Edit the site** The website files are contained in the `src` directory, and the site navigation is defined in `src/_quarto.yml`, try editing these files and either clicking the "Preview" button in VS Code, or calling `quarto preview src` from the command line.
